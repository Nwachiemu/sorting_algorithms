0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Background Context<br>
âœ” This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.<br>

Learning Objectives<br>
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:<br>

General<br>
- At least four different sorting algorithms<br>
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm<br>
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input<br>
- imWhat is a stable sorting algorithm<br>
